# Runescape Flip Calc

First C# console app that simply allows you to calculate how much you'll make off a flip given the item, starting price, ending price, GE limit, and tax. The idea is to expand on it and add a UI and hopefully some way to keep track of your previous flips.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and use `dotnet run` which will handle the `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build`

### Prerequisites

The only package you'll need to install as of right now is listed below (along with the .NET SDK of course)
